C                                   
Someone told me long ago there s a calm before the storm,
  G                     C
I know; it s been comin for some time.
C
When its over, so they say, it ll rain a sunny day,
  G                      C
I know; shinin down like water.

I want to know, have you ever seen the rain
      G               C
Comin down on a sunny day? 

C
Yesterday, and days before, sun is cold and rain is hard,
  G                       C
I know; been that way for all my time.
C
till forever, on it goes through the circle, fast and slow,
  G                      C
I know; it can t stop, I wonder.

F         G              C             Am  Am G F

      G               C
Comin down on a sunny day?
