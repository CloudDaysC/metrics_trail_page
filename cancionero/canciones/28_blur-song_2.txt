F Eb Ab Bb C x2

       F Eb Ab Bb C
WOOHOO!              X4

              F       Eb Ab Bb C
I got my head checked 
           F   Eb Ab Bb C
By a jumbo jet 
            F  Eb Ab Bb C
It wasn't easy 
             F Eb Ab Bb C
But nothing is,         no

       F Eb 
WOOHOO!
       Ab      Bb C		    F Eb 
When I feel heavy metal WOOHOO!
        Ab       Bb  C		   F Eb 
And I'm pins and I'm needles WOOHOO!
       Ab      Bb  C 
Well I lie and I'm easy
F                       Ab               Db
All of the time but I'm never sure why I need you 
                    F Eb Ab Bb C
Pleased to meet you! 

F Eb Ab Bb C

                  F Eb Ab Bb C
I got my head done 
           F  Eb Ab Bb C
When I was young 
                   F Eb Ab Bb C
It's not my problem 
            F  Eb   Ab Bb C
It's not my problem
