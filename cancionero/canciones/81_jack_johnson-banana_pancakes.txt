Am7 G7
                                  Am7
Well can't you see that it's just rainin'
                          G7
There ain't no need to go outside 


    C7        G7          D7
But baby, you hardly even notice
Am7           C7
When I try to show you
     G7               D7
This song is meant to keep you
     Am7                 C7
From doin' what you're supposed to
G7            D7
Wakin' up too early
Am7            C7
Maybe we could sleep in
G7              D7
Make you banana pancakes
   Am7                C7      Am7
Pretend like it's the weekend now 


[riff]
                                G7
And we could pretend it all the time
                             Am7
Can't you see that it's just rainin'
                          G7
There ain't no need to go outside 


         C7     G7      D7
But just maybe, laka ukulele
Am7         C7
Mama made a baby
G7                   D7
Really don't mind to practice
        Am7              C7
Because you're my little lady
G7         D7
Lady, lady love me
         Am7              C7
'Cause I love to lay here lazy
G7                 D7
We could close the curtains
   Am7                  C7    Am7
Pretend like there's no world outside


[riff]
                                G7
And we could pretend it all the time 
                                 Am7
And can't you see that it's just raining
                          G7
There ain't no need to go outside 


                        Am7
Ain't no need, ain't no need
         G7
mmmm mmmm
                         Am7
Can't you see, can't you see
                         G7
Rain all day and I don't mind


        Am7
But the telephone's singing, ringing
                              D
It's too early, don't pick it up
We don't need to
       Am7
We got everything we need right here
                           D
And everything we need is enough
Just so easy
         Bm
When the whole world fits inside of your arms 
      Em
Do we really need to pay attention to the alarm
        G7
Wake up slow
     Am7
mmmm mmmm
        G7
Wake up slow 


    C7        G7          D7
But baby, you hardly even notice
Am7           C7
When I try to show you
     G7               D7
This song is meant to keep you
     Am7                 C7
From doin' what your supposed to
G7            D7
Wakin' up too early
Am7            C7
Maybe we could sleep in
G7              D7
Make you banana pancakes
   Am7                C7      Am7
Pretend like it's the weekend now


[riff]
                                G7
And we could pretend it all the time 
                             Am7
Can't you see that it's just rainin'
                          G7
There ain't no need to go outside 


                        Am7
Ain't no need, ain't no need
                   G7
Rain all day and I really, really, really don't mind
                         Am7
Can't you see, can't you see 
                  G7
You gotta wake up slow
