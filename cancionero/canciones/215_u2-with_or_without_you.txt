G         D                 Em
 See the stone set in your eyes
          
          C                   G
 See the thorn twist in your side

           D       Em    C
 And I'll wait for you

G            D                Em
 Sleight of hand and twist of fate

              C                   G
 On a bed of nails, she makes me wait

           D        Em      C
 And I'll wait, without you--

              G    D              Em     C 
 With or without you, with or without you




G             D                  Em
 Through the storm we reach the shore

              C              G
 You give it all but I want more

           D        Em   C
 And I'll wait for you


          G              D            Em            C
 And you give yourself away, and you give yourself away

          G              D
 And you give, And you give,

          Em            C
 And you give yourself away



             G      D         Em           C
 With or without you, with or without you I--

          G   D             Em     C
 I can't live-- with or without you


G  D  Em  C 


G              D
 My hands are tied, 

Em        C                     G
 my body bruised, she's got me with

             D        Em              C
 nothing to win, and nothing left to lose



          G             D
 And you give yourself away

          Em            C
 And you give yourself away

          G              D
 And you give, And you give,

          Em            C
 And you give yourself away



              G      D
 With or without you,

          Em           C
 With or without you I--

          G   D             Em     C    G.   
 I can't live-- with or without you.
