Snow Patrol - Chasing Cars
Capo 2

C                G        Am           C
We'll do it all, everything, on our own
C	   G	    Am         C
We don't need anything, or anyone.

    C			G
If I lay here, if I just lay here
		Am			    C
Would you lie with me, and just forget the world.

C              G	   Am            C
I don't quite know how to say how I feel
C		G		Am		C
Those three words, I said too much, but not enough.

C			G
If I lay here, if I just lay here
	   Am			 	C
Would you lie with me, and just forget the world.
C					G
Forget what we're told, before we get too old
	   Am				C
Show me a garden that's bursting into life.

C		G	    Am		     C
Let's waste time, chasing cars, around our heads.
C		G	    Am		    C
I need your grace to remind me, to find my own.

C			G
If I lay here, if I just lay here
		Am			   C
Would you lie with me, and just forget the world.
C					G
Forget what we're told, before we get too old
	   Am				C
Show me a garden that's bursting into life.

C			G
All that I am, all that I ever was 
			Am			C
Is here in your perfect eyes, they're all I can see
C				   G
I don't know where, confused about how as well
			Am				C
just know that these things will never change for us at all.

C			G
If I lay here, if I just lay here
		Am			C
Would you lie with me, and just forget the world.

Hope it works for you, Jonny
