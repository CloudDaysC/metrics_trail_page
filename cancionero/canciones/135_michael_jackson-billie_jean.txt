So since the death of the "King of Pop", everyone has been submitting
Michael Jackson tabs. So I thought I would give it a shot. If you have any
problems with the tab just listen to the song then play. And when you've
made your final judgement, please rate and/or leave a comment.

(The rhythm of the song is based off the baseline. So just try and mimic
it. For the verses and choruses, I throw in some palm mutes to make it more interesting.)


Capo 2nd FRET

Intro:

Em (I counted about 24 measures of Em. Feel free to shorten if you want.) 

Verse 1:

Em      
She was more like a beauty queen, from a movie scene,
                                                   Am
I said; don't mind, but what do you mean; I am the one?
                                    Em   
Who will dance on the floor, in the round.
                   Am                                       Em
She said; I am the one, who will dance on the floor, in the round.

Interlude:

Em 2xs

Verse 2:

Em          
She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene.
                                                            Am
Then every head turned, with eyes that dreamed of being the one,
                                    Em
Who will dance on the floor, in the round.

Interlude:

Em 2xs

Pre-chorus:

C                          Em
People always told me; be careful what you do;
          C                               Em
And don't go around breaking young girl's hearts.
    C                         Em
And mother always told me; be careful of who you love;
       C                                B7
And be careful of what you do, 'cos the lie becomes the truth.

Chorus 1:

Em      
Billie Jean is not my lover;
                                            Am
She's just a girl who, claims that I am the one.
                      Em 
But the kid is not my son.
                   Am
She says; I am the one,
                      Em 
But the kid is not my son.

Interlude:

Em  2xs

Verse 3:

Em   
For forty days and forty nights, the law was on her side.
                                                         Am
But who can stand, when she's in demand, her schemes and plans?
                                    Em    
'Cos we danced on the floor, in the round.
Em                                                     
So take my strong advice; just remember to always think twice.
 Em
(Do think twice).

Verse 4:

Em           
She told my baby we'd danced 'till three, then she looked a me,
                                                         Am
Then showed a photo; my baby cried; his eyes looked like mine.
                                 Em     
Go on dance on the floor, in the round, baby.

Pre-chorus 2:

C                          Em
People always told me; be careful what you do;
          C                               Em
And don't go around breaking young girl's hearts.
    C                                    Em
She came and stood right by me; then the smell of sweet perfume.
     C                           B7
This happened much too soon; she called me to her room.

Chorus 2:

Em      
 Billie Jean is not my lover;
                                            Am
She's just a girl who, claims that I am the one.
                      Em 
But the kid is not my son.
                   Am
She says; I am the one,
                      Em 
But the kid is not my son.
Em      
Billie Jean is not my lover;
                                            Am
She's just a girl who, claims that I am the one.
                      Em  
But the kid is not my son.
                   Am
She says; I am the one,
                      Em 
But the kid is not my son.

Bridge:

Em

Em     
 Billie Jean is not my lover.
Em      
 Billie Jean is not my lover,
Em      
 Billie Jean is not my lover.

(Fade Out)

And that should be that for Billie Jean by the late Michael Jackson. If it
doesn't sound perfect then it sounds pretty close to it. And once again,
