Creep chords
Radiohead 

G B7 C Cm

                     G
When you were here before,
                         B7
couldn t look you in the eye
                    C
You re just like an angel,
                   Cm
your skin makes me cry

                 G
You float like a feather,
               B7
in a beautiful world
             C
I wish I was special;
               Cm
you re so very special

          G
But I m a creep,
      B7
I m a weirdo
                         C
What the hell am I doing here?
          Cm
I don t belong here

                   G
I don t care if it hurts,
                B7
I wanna have control
                 C
I want a perfect body;
                 Cm
I want a perfect soul

              G
I want you to notice,
              B7
when I m not around
               C
You re so very special;
             Cm
I wish I was special

          G
But I m a creep,
      B7
I m a weirdo
                         C
What the hell am I doing here?
          Cm
I don t belong here, ohhhh, ohhhh

G                     B7
She s running out the door,
C
she s running out
    Cm
she run run run run
  
run

                   G
Whatever makes you happy,
             B7
whatever you want
               C
You re so very special;
             Cm
I wish I was special

          G
But I m a creep,
      B7
I m a weirdo
                         C
What the hell am I doing here?
          Cm
I don t belong here

C         Cm
I don t belong here
