Intro (picking optional):
G Cadd9 Em D 

Verse 1: 
     G     Cadd9
an old man
 Em                D
turned ninety-eight
                 G      Cadd9
he won the lottery
        Em              C
and died the next day
         G      Cadd9
it's a black fly
     Em            D
in your chardonnay
        G               Cadd9
it's a death row pardon
         Em            C
two minutes too late
         G          D
and isnt it ironic?
                C
dont you think
 
Chorus:
              G, Cadd9
it's like rain
              Em      D
on your wedding day
           G,  Cadd9
it's a free ride
                  Em        C
when you've already paid
           G,     Cadd9
it's a good advice
             Em           D
that you just didn't take
        G                       D
and who would have thought
        C
it figures ?
 
Verse 2:
Mr. Play-It-Safe
was afraid to fly
he packed his suitcase
and kissed his kids goodbye
he waited his whole damn life
to take that flight
and as the plane crashed down
he thought; well isn't this nice..

and isn't it ironic?
don't you think

Chorus
it's like rain
on your wedding day
it's a free ride
when you've already paid
it's a good advice
that you just didnt take
and who would have thought
it figures
       G               D
Well life has a funny way
       Em           C 
of sneaking up on you
          G                 D
When you think everything's okay 
                        C
and everything's going right
       G               D
And life has a funny way
     Em               C 
of helping you out when
       G                    D
You think everything's gone wrong 
                              C
and everything blows up in your face

Verse 3:
A traffic jam when you're already late
A no-smoking sign on your cigarette break
It's like ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife
It's meeting the man of my dreams
And then meeting his beautiful wife

And isn't it ironic, don't you think
A little too ironic, and yeah I really do think

Chorus
It's like rain on your wedding day
It's a free ride when you've already paid
It's the good advice that you just didn't take
And who would've thought, it figures

Life has a funny way of sneaking up on you
Life has a funny, funny way of helping you out
Helping you out
