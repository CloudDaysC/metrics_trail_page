Am         F               C                G 
Another head hangs lowly child is slowly taken 
Am               F                   C               G 
And the violence caused such silence who are we mistaken 
         Am                       F 
But you see it's not me, it's not my family,  
        C                               G 
In your head, in your head, they are fighting 
           Am              F             C                           G 
With their tanks and their bombs in your head, in your head, the are crying. 


Chorus:

        Am            F            C             G
In your head, in your head, zombie, zombie, zombie 
               Am            F            C             G
What's in your head, in your head, zombie, zombie, zombie 


Verse:
Am        F                  C              G 
Anothers mother's breaking, heart is taking over. 
Am               F               C            g 
When the violence caused silence, we must be mistaken. 
         Am                  F  
It's the same old theme since 1916, 
        C                                  G 
in your head, in your head, they're still fighting 
           Am                              F  
With their tanks and their bombs en' their guns, 
        C                            G 
In your head, in your head, they're dying. 


Chorus:
        Am            F            C            G 
In your head, in your head, zombie, zombie, zombie 
               Am            F            C             G
What's in your head, in your head, zombie, zombie, zombie
