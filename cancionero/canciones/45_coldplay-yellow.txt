So I heard this version of "Yellow" from a video of Coldplay performing live at 
BBC. Will plays resonator for this version but a regular guitar will work too. 
Hope it's accurate and that it works for you guys. Thanks and like i said, hope it 
works!! To see the video look here

Chords: D- x00232
        A- xx7655
        G- xx5433

I think it's fairly simple and basic and better for those who have deeper voices 
to sing in like Chris does in this version. 


Intro - D 

D
Look at the stars, 
                         A
Look how they shine for you, 
                    G
And everything you do, 

Yeah they were all yellow, 
D
I came along 
                    A
I wrote a song for you 
                        G
And all the things you do 
                         D
And it was called yellow 
                   A
So then I took my turn 
                        G
Oh all the things I've done 
                      D
And it was all yellow 
G
Your skin 
D
Oh yeah your skin and bones 
G          D          
Turn into something beautiful 
G           D                     A
D'you know you know I love you so 
                      D
You know I love you so 
[Just play a D chord for a short period as the interlude]

D
I swam across 
                     G
I jumped across for you 
                      A
Oh all the things you do 

Cause you were all yellow 
D
I drew a line 
                   G
I drew a line for you 
                    A
Oh what a thing to do 
                      D
And it was all yellow 

G 
Your skin 
D
Oh yeah your skin and bones 
G          D
Turn into something beautiful 
G           D                      A
D'you know for you i bleed myself dry
                          D
For you i bleed myself dry 

{For the outro It is just a d chord strummed repeatedly]
D
Its true look how they shine for you

D                                           A

                        G
And all the things you do
