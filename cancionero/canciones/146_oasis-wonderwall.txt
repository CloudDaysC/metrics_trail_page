Em  G  D  A  x4


Em         G
Today is gonna be the day 
              D                     A            
That they're gonna throw it back to you 
Em           G
By now you should've somehow 
    D                  A
Realized what you gotta do 
Em                   G
I don't believe that anybody 
D               A         
Feels the way I do
      C       D   A   A
About you now 



Em           G
Backbeat the word was on the street 
         D                    A
That the fire in your heart is out 
Em              G
I'm sure you've heard it all before 
        D                  A
But you never really had a doubt 
Em                    G
I don't believe that anybody
D               A
Feels the way I do 
         Em    G   D   A
About you now 



    C                D                     Em     Em
And all the roads we have to walk along are winding 
    C                   D                 Em      Em
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding 
C             D           
There are many things that I would 
G       D/F#   Em
Like to say to you 
     D           A   A   A
but I don't know how 


        C     Em    G
Because maybe 
Em                           C          Em   G
You're gonna be the one that saves me ? 
    Em    C    Em 
And after all 
G         Em    C    Em  G  Em-STOP
You're my wonderwall 




Em         G
Today is gonna be the day 
              D                     A

Em           G
By now you should've somehow 
    D                  A
Realized what you gotta do 
Em                   G
I don't believe that anybody 
D               A         
Feels the way I do
