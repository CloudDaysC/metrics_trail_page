I STILL HAVEN'T FOUND WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR

        C           F       C
I have climbed the highest mountain
       C   F            C
I have run through the fields
        F         Bb   F
Only to be with you
 F      C          F    C
Only to be with you

        C     F      C
I have run, I have crawled
          C     F          C
I have scaled these city walls
 C          F    Bb  F
These city walls 
F       C        F      C
Only to be with you

       G            F                C          F   C
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
       G            F                C          F    C
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for


I have kissed honey lips

Felt the healing in her fingertips

It burned like fire

This burning desire

I have spoke with the tongue of angels

I have held the hand of a devil

It was warm in the night

I was cold as a stone


But I still haven't found what I'm looking for

But I still haven't found what I'm looking for




I believe in the kingdom come

Then all the colors will bleed into one

Bleed into one

Well, yes, I'm still running

You broke the bonds and you

Loosed the chains

Carried the cross

And all my shame

All my shame

You know I believe it


But I still haven't found what I'm looking for

But I still haven't found what I'm looking for

But I still haven't found what I'm looking for

But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
