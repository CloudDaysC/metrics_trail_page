D                     G
I have built a city here

G                     D
I need you like a hurricane

Thunder crashing wind and rain
               C
Tear my walls down, I<U+0092>m only yours now
G                           D

D                       G
I am yours and you are mine

You know far better than I

And if destruction is all I need
Em            D                 C
Then I<U+0092>ll receive it Lord from thee
