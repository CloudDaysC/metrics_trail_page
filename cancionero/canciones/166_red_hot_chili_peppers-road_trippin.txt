Am                       F         Em
road trippin with my two favourite allies
Am                  F          Em
Fully loaded we got snacks and supplies
Am 
It's time to leave this town
F                  Em
It's time to steal away
Am
Let's go get lost
F                   Em
Anywhere in the U.S.A. 

Chorus:
Am
Let's go get lost
             F  Em
Let's go get lost
Am
Blue you sit so pretty
F           Em
West of the one
Am                        F
Sparkle light with yellow icing
       Em             Am
Just a mirror for the sun
F      Em             Am
Just a mirror for the sun
F      Em             Am
Just a mirror for the sun
Am                            F      Em
These Smiling eyes are just a mirror for......

(after that just follow the same pattern)

So much has come before those battles lost and won
This life is shining more forever in the sun
Now let us check our heads
And let us check the surf
Staying high and dry's
More trouble than it's worth
In the sun

Just a mirror for the sun
Just a mirror for the sun

These Smiling eyes are just a mirror for

In Big Sur we take some time to linger on
We three hunky dories got our snakefinger on
Now let us drink the stars
It's time to steal away
Let's go get lost
Right here in the U.S.A

Chorus
Let's go get lost
Let's go get lost
Blue you sit so pretty
West of the one
Sparkle light with yellow icing
Just a mirror for the sun
Just a mirror for the sun
Just a mirror for the sun
These smiling eyes are just a mirror for
These smiling eyes are just a mirror for
Your smiling eyes are just a mirror for
