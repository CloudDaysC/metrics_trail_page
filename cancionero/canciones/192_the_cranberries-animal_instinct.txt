Suddenly something has happened to me
            D
As I was having my cup of tea
 Em         C               C7TH
Suddenly I was feeling depressed
        D
I was utterly and totally stressed
 Em    C               C7TH    D
Do you know you made me cry
 Em    C               C7TH    D
Do you know you made me die

 Em                       C
And the thing that gets to me
 C7TH                      D
Is you<U+0092>ll never really see
 Em                        C
And the thing that freaks me out
 C7TH                       D
Is I'll always be in doubt
 Em       C                  C7TH
It is a lovely thing that we have
          D
It is a lovely thing that we
 Em       C                 C7TH
It is a lovely thing, the animal
           D
The animal instinct
{And Repeat}
So take my hands and come with me
We will change reality
So take my hands and we will pray
They won't take you away
They will never make me cry, no
They will never make me die
And the thing that gets to me
Is you'll never really see
And the thing that freaks me out
Is I'll always be in doubt

The animal, the animal,
The animal instinct in me
It's the animal, the animal,
The animal instinct in me
It's the animal, it<U+0092>s the animal,
It's the animal instinct in me x2

Enjoy!
