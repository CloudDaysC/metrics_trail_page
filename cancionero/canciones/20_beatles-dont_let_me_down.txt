                          D                               A
I'm in love for the first time.  Don't you know it's gonna last.

                       A7                               D
It's a love that lasts forever, It's a love that has no past.

             Em7                     D
Don't let me down,      Don't let me down

                                         Em7                   
And from the first time that she really done me, ooh she done me, she done
    D
me good.

Don't let me down,      Don't let me down
