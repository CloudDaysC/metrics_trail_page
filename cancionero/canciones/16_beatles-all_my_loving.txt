I took this from a book of sheet music so it should be correct


            Am            D7
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
   G           Em 
Tomorrow I'll miss you
   C          Am           F
Remember I'll always be true
          Am          D7
And then while I'm away
            G         Em
I'll write home everyday
           C          D          G
And I'll send all my loving to you



        Em
All my loving 
G+              G
I will send to you
        Em
All my loving
G+                G
Darling I'll be true



         Am            D7    
I'll pretend that I'm kissing
      G       Em
The lips I am missing
      C            Am               F
And hope that my dreams will come true
          Am         D7
And then while I'm away
             G        Em
I'll write home everyday
           C           D
And I'll send all my loving to you



        Em
All my loving 
G+              G
I will send to you
        Em
All my loving
G+                G
Darling I'll be true
