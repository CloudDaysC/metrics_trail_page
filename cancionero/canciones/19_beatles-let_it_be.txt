But though they may be parted, there is still a chance that they may see

And when the night is cloudy, there is still a light that shines on me
C                 G            F C Dm7 C
Shine on till tomorrow, let it be

  C              G               Am          F
I wake up to the sound of music, Mother Mary comes to me
