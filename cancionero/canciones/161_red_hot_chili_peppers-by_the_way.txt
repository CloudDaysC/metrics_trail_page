Since there is only one version of this amazing song in chords I revised 
and updated it. I think that this update is as complete as it can be. There
is no Bb chord in the 1st version and this chord surely appears in the song.
There are also some clues about string muting. There is also this changing
between Am and Dm chords. Enjoy!!!
