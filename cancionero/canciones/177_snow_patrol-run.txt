Am Fmaj7 G x2


             Am       Fmaj7     G 
I'll sing it one last time for you

        Am     Fmaj7   G
Then we really have to go.

                Am    Fmaj7        G
You've been the only things that's right.

            Am      Fmaj      G
In all I've done.

          Am     Fmaj7    G
And I can barely look at you.

          Am     Fmaj7   G
But every single time I do.

             Am      Fmaj7  G 
I know we'll make it anywhere.

         Am    Fmaj7   G
Away from here.


Chorous.

C                              G
Light up, Light up. As if you have a choice.

                         Am     
Even though you can not hear my voice.

                          Fmaj7
I'll be right beside you dear.

C                              G
Louder, louder. And we'll run for our lives.

                           Am
I can hardly speak, I understand.

                                   Fmaj7
Why you can't raise your voice to say.

Am    Fmaj7   G x2 

           Am        Fmaj7      G
To think I might not see those eyes.

           Am     Fmaj7   G
Makes it so hard not to cry.

           Am     Fmaj7    G
And as we say our long goodbyes.

          Am    Fmaj7    G
I nearly do.

Chorous.

C                             G
Light up, light up. As if you have a choice.

                    Am
Even if you can not hear. My voice

                           Fmaj7
I'll be right beside you dear.

C                             G
Louder, louder. And we'll run for our lives

                          Am
I can hardly speak, I understand.

                                  Fmaj7
Why you can't raise your voice to say.

C                            G
Slower, Slower. We dont have time for that.

                        Am
All I want is to find an easier way.

                           Fmaj7
To get out of our little heads.

C                                   G
Have heart, my dear. We're bound to be afraid.

                     Am     
Even if its just for a few days.

                           Fmaj7
Makin' up for all of this mess.


Solo- play over it how you would play the chorous twice.

C                             G
Light up, Light up. As if you have a choice.

                    Am
Even if you can not hear my voice. 

                         Fmaj7              (single strum) C
I'll be right beside you dear.
