Linkin Park - Numb (Meteora)

Standard Tuning
Capo on 2nd

Em                            C
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
G                         D
Feeling so faithless lost under the surface
Em                         C
Don't know what you're expecting of me
    G                     D                C
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
                             D
(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)
      Em                     G                 C
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
                               D
(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)


[Chorus]
Em             C                     G
I've become so numb I can't feel you there
          D                   Em
Become so tired so much more aware
             C                  G
I'm becoming this all I want to do
                D                   Em
Is be more like me and be less like you

                            C
Can't you see that you're smothering me
G                    D
Holding too tightly afraid to lose control
Em                            C        
Cause everything that you thought I would be
    G              D                 C
Has fallen apart right in front of you
                             D                        
(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)
E                            G                  C
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
                             D
(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)
          Em                          G
And every second I waste is more than I can take


[Chorus]
Em             C                     G
I've become so numb I can't feel you there
          D                   Em
Become so tired so much more aware
             C                  G
I'm becoming this all I want to do
                D                   C
Is be more like me and be less like you

        D
And I know
      Em  F# G  Bm   C
I may end up failing too
         D
But I know
         Bm                        Bm               Bm
You were just like me with someone disappointed in you


[Chorus]
Em             C                     G
I've become so numb I can't feel you there
          D                   Em
Become so tired so much more aware
             C                  G
I'm becoming this all I want to do
                D                   Em
Is be more like me and be less like you


[Chorus]
Em             C                     G
I've become so numb I can't feel you there
                             D
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Em             C                     G
I've become so numb I can't feel you there
                            D            
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
