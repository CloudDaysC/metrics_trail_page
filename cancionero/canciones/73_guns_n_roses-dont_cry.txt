Continue same chord pattern in verses and in chorus

Give me a whisper
and give me a sigh
Give me a kiss before you
tell me goodbye
Don't you take it so hard now 
and please don't take it so bad
I'll still be thinking of you
and the times we had, baby

(chorus)

Play the solo the same way you play the verse

And please remember
that i never lied
Oh, and please remember 
how i felt inside, now honey
You gotta make it your own way
but you'll be alright, now sugar
you'll fell better tomorrow
in the morning light now baby

chorus to end
