E                           A    E
I walk the streets of Japan till I get lost
E                          A    E
Cause it doesn't remind me of anything
E                    A    E
With a graveyard tan carrying a cross
E                          A    E
Cause it doesn't remind me of anything
E                     A    E
I like studying faces in a parking lot
E                          A    E
Cause it doesn't remind me of anything
E                        A    E
I like driving backwards in the fog
E                          A    E
Cause it doesn't remind me of anything

Chorus:

E               D              A                E
The things that I've loved the things that I've lost
E             D               A          E
The things I've held sacred that I've dropped
E        D          A       E
I won't lie no more you can bet
E               D               A
I don't want to learn what I'll need to forget

E                  A    E
I like gypsy moths and radio talk
E                          A    E
Cause it doesn't remind me of anything
E                       A    E
I like gospel music and canned applause
E                          A    E
Cause it doesn't remind me of anything
E                        A    E
I like colorful clothing in the sun
E                          A    E
Cause it doesn't remind me of anything
E                        A    E
I ilke hammering nails and speaking in tongues
E                          A    E
Cause it doesn't remind me of anything

Chorus:

E               D              A                E
The things that I've loved the things that I've lost
E             D               A          E
The things I've held sacred that I've dropped
E        D          A       E
I won't lie no more you can bet
E               D               A
I don't want to learn what I'll need

Bridge:

Dm
Bend and shape me
C
I love the way you are
A         Am
Slow and sweetly
G           E
Like never before
Dm
Calm and sleeping
C
We won't stir up the past
A     Am
So descretely
G
We won't look back

E A D E x4

Chorus:

E               D              A                E
The things that I've loved the things that I've lost
E             D               A          E
The things I've held sacred that I've dropped
E        D          A       E
I won't lie no more you can bet
E               D               A
I don't want to learn what I'll need

E                        A    E
I like throwing my voice and breaking guitars
E                          A    E
Cause it doesn't remind me of anything
E                          A    E
I like playing in the sand what's mine is ours
E                     A      E    E
If it doesn't remind me of anything

Enjoy the tab :)
