The song is made up of nice simple riffs
I've written riffs in bars because timing is important and i've written the beats 
at the top of the bars.
Keep playing the chord and count out the beats until it changes

Tuning: Standard EADGBe

The song is actually played in F major (capo 5) but it sounds fine without a capo

Chords:
C   : x32010
Bm7 : x20202

*You may find the G chord after the F chord in the 4th measure in Riff 1 easier as 
a barre chord (355433)
as it only requires you to slide up 2 frets from the F barre chord

Here shows how the riffs fit in with the words:


Intro:

Verse 1:
[Play Riff 1 twice]
C         Bm7     E7                  Am       G  F
Yesterday, All my troubles seemed so far away,
         G*                    C

Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be
         G*              C                         
There's a shadow hanging over me,

Oh, yesterday came suddenly.

Why   she   had to go,
Am Dm6            G7        C        
I don't know, she wouldn't say.
E   E7   Am    G   F

Oh, I believe in yesterday.
