Here is a fun way to play this classic that incorporates the guitar strumming along with 
bass line that
goes throughout the song. It works great
when playing an acoustic by yourself. enjoy...


           C                            Am                     F
e----------0-0--0-------0-0--0----------0-0--0-----0-0--0-------1-1--1-----|
b----------1-1--1-------1-1--1----------1-1--1-----1-1--1-------1-1--1-----|
g----------0-0--0-------0-0--0----------2-2--2-----2-2--2-------2-2--2-----|
d----------2-2--2-------2-2--2----------2-2--2-----2-2--2-------3-3--3-----|
a----2-3---3-3--3--2-3--3-3--3--3-2-0---0-0--0--0--0-0--0-0-----3-3--3---0-|
E---3-------------3---------------------------3*-----------3-1--1-1--1--1--|

    G             C
e---3-3-3---------0-0--0---------0-0--0--|

a---2-2-2----2-3--3-3--3----2-3--3-3--3--|
E-3-3-3-3--3--------------3--------------|

That progression repeats for the duration of the song. Its simple yet effective and a 
of fun to play/sing.
The chords can be strummed as shown, picked,
or both however you see fit. The timing is the main aspect.
Mix it up. Have fun with it...

Lyrics:
         C
When the night has come
        Am
And the land is dark
        F           G                  C
And the moon is the only light we'll see
No I won't be afraid, no I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

And darlin', darlin', stand by me, oh now now stand by me
Stand by me, stand by me

If the sky that we look upon
Should tumble and fall
And the mountains should crumble to the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry, no I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

And darlin', darlin', stand by me, oh stand by me
Stand by me, stand by me, stand by me-e, yeah

Whenever you're in trouble won't you stand by me, oh now now stand by me
Oh stand by me, stand by me, stand by me

Darlin', darlin', stand by me-e, stand by me
Oh stand by me, stand by me, stand by me


*i fret this note with my pinky so i can keep holding the Am. Happy picking
