VERSE
            G                         C G    C
She was a fast machine, she kept her motor clean
     G        D                     G   
She was the best damn woman I had ever seen 
              G                     C      G  C  G
She had the sightless eyes telling me no lies
G      D                       G     D     G 
And knockin' me out with those american thighs
         G                        C           G   C  G
Taking more than her share, had me fighting for air 
  D                             G
She told me to come, but I was already there
             G                       C    G   C    G
'Cause the walls stop shaking, the earth was quaking
D                                            G
My mind was aching and we were making and you -

Working double line, on the seduction line
     G   D                       G
She was one of a kind, She just mine all mine
        G                    C   G  C  G
Wanted no applause, just another course
        D                   G    D       G
Made a meal out of me and came back for more
         G                 C     G    C    G
Had to cool me down to take another round
         D                         G
Now im back in the ring to take another swing
          G                       C      G   C   G
Cause the walls were shaking, the earth was quaking
D                                              G
My mind was aching and we were making it and you
