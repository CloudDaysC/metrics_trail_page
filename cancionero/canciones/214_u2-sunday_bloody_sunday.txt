(Intro-Riff A)
Bm              D                     G
I can't believe the news today
Oh, I can't close my eyes and make it go away
D
How long?
Em            
How long must we sing this song?
D                    Em
How long, how long?
B               D  G
'Cause tonight we can be as one, tonight!
Broken bottles under children's feet
Bodies strewn across the dead-end street
But I won't heed the battle call
It puts my back up against the wall

Sunday, bloody Sunday
Sunday, bloody Sunday

And the battle's just begun
There's many lost, but tell me who has won?
The trenches dug within our hearts
And mother's children, brothers, sisters torn apart

Sunday, bloody Sunday
Sunday, bloody Sunday

Wipe the tears from your eyes
Wipe your tears away
Wipe your bloodshot eyes

Sunday, bloody Sunday
Sunday, bloody Sunday

And it's true we are immune
When fact is fiction and T.V. is reality
And today the millions cry
We eat and drink while tomorrow they die
The real battle just begun
To claim the victory Jesus won,
On Sunday, bloody Sunday
Sunday, bloody Sunday...


during the B D G progression, you can add 
in an A at the end to make it sound cool...
