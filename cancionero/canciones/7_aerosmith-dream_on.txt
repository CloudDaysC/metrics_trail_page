Hey Guys! I just love this song so much (and listen to it constantly!) and decided 
to put it into easy chords for you guys! It sounds pretty good and is great for beginners. Enjoy!

Intro: 
 (Em) (Em7) (Em6) (Am6) 
 (Em) (B7) (Em)

Verse:
(Em)     (Em7)  (Em6)       (Am6)
   Every time I look in the mirror
(Em)   (Em7)             (Em6)        (Am6)
   All these lines on my face gettin' clearer
(Em)  (Em7)         (Em6)  (Am6)
        The past is gone
(Em)    (Em7)   (Em6)   (Am6)
It went by like dusk to dawn
(Em6)              (B7sus4)  (B7)
    Isn't that the way 
(Em6)                 (B7sus4)        (B7)   (Cmaj7)(C#7)(B7)
Everybody's got their dues in life to pay?

Bridge:
(Em)   (D)          (C)                (D)         
I know nobody knows where it comes and where it goes
(Em)          (D)
  I know it's everybody's sin
(C)                 (D)        (Em)
You got to lose to know how to win

Interlude:
(Em7) (Em6) (Am6) (Em) (B7) (Em)

Verse (Repeat chord progression from last verse minus last two lines):

Half my life's in books' written pages
Lived and learned from fools and from sages
You know its true
all those things come back to you

Pre-Chorus:
(Em)          (D)
Sing with me, sing for the years
(C)                    (D)
Sing for laughter 'n' sing for the tears
(Em)                  (D)
Sing with me if it's just for today
(Em/C#)               (Cmaj7)                        
  Maybe tomorrow the   good Lord will take you away
(Am6)(Am add 6/9) x 8

Chorus:
(Am)       (B5)     (C)
Dream on, dream on, dream on
      (E)                   (Em)
Dream yourself a dream come true
(Am)       (B5)      (C)
Dream on, dream on, dream on
       (E)                    (Em)
Dream until your dream comes true
(Am)      (B5)       (C)       (D)
Dream on, Dream on, Dream on, Dream on
(Am)      (B5)       (C)     (Dsus4)

(Am6) (Am add 6/9) x 8
Ah------
