             Dreaming my Dreams- The Cranberries
             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                  

Verse:
   C       G          Am           F
 All the things you said to me today
   C       G          Am           F
 Changed my perspective in every way
   C       G          Am        F
 These things count to mean so much to me
   C       G          Am       F
 Into my faith you and your baby


Bridge:
 C           G
 It's out there
 Am          F  
 It's out there 
 C           G
 It's out there
    Am                  F 
 If you want me I'll be here

 Repeat 

Chorus:
   C         G             Am        F
 I'll be dreaming my dreams with you
   C         G             Am        F
 I'll be dreaming my dreams with you
    C       G          Am                 F
 And there's no other place that I'd lay down my faith
   C       G          Am       F
  dreaming my dreams with you

 Instrumental: Just play the chorus chords with an 
 arpeggio style using only 1 downstroke per chord. Then pluck
 the three top strings in this order: 1,2,3,2. On the last chord 
 do not pluck. 

 
 Bridge

 
 Chorus

 The song ends on a C  
 
 C:x32010      G:320003- I use 320033
 Am:002210     F:133211
I didn't have much time to check it, so I'm not to sure about the bridge
chords. But if you lsten to the album a couple of times you should be 
able to get it.
