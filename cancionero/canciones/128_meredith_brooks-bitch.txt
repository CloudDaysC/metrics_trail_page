(Standard Tuning)




G                      D Am
I hate the world today
                       G                      D Am
You're so good to me I know but I can't change

I tried to tell you but you
Am              
look at me like maybe
          G             D
I'm an angel underneath; innocent and sweet

G                 D Am
Yesterday I cried; Must've been
                G             D Am
relief to see the softer side
                        Am      
I can undertsand how you'd be so confused
G
I don't envy you; I'm a
        Am      
little bit of everything
D
all rolled into one

   G          D
I'm a bitch I'm a lover
   Am          C
I'm a child I'm a mother
    G           D
I'm a sinner I'm a saint 
    Am             C
I do not feel ashamed
     G            D
I'm your hell I'm your dream
    Am              C
I'm nothing in between
            G                  D        Am    C 
you know you wouldn't want it any other way


G                      D Am
So take me as I am

This might mean you'll have
G                      D Am
to be a stronger man
                        
Rest assured that when I start
Am
to make you nervous
        G                Am
I'm going to extremes; Tomorrow I will change
D
And today won't mean a thing

G          D
I'm a bitch I'm a lover
   Am          C
I'm a child I'm a mother
    G           D
I'm a sinner I'm a saint 
    Am             C
I do not feel ashamed
     G            D
I'm your hell I'm your dream
    Am              C
I'm nothing in between
            G                  D        Am    C 
you know you wouldn't want it any other way

E                                       
Just when you think, you got me figured out
fis                     D
The season's already changin'
E               fis
I think it's cool; you do what you do
D                       
And don't try to save me

G          D
I'm a bitch I'm a lover
   Am          C
I'm a child I'm a mother
    G           D
I'm a sinner I'm a saint 
    Am             C
I do not feel ashamed
     G            D
I'm your hell I'm your dream
    Am              C
I'm nothing in between
            G                  D        Am    C 
you know you wouldn't want it any other way




G                 D
I'm a bitch, I'm a tease
Am                C
I'm a goddess on my knees
G                 D
When you hurt; when you suffer
Am                C
I'm your angel undercover
G                 D
I've been numb; I'm revived
Am                C
Can't say I'm not alive
G             D           Am          C
You know I wouldn't want it any other way
