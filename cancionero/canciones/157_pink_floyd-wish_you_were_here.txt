Wish You Were Here chords
Pink Floyd

G Em  G Em  G Em  A Em A G  2x

C                        D
So, so you think you can tell 
            Am
Heaven from Hell, 
                G
Blue skies from pain. 
                     D
Can you tell a green field 
                  C
From a cold steel rail? 
               Am
A smile from a veil? 
                     G
Do you think you can tell? 

                        C
And did they get you to trade 
                D
Your heroes for ghosts? 
              Am
Hot ashes for trees? 
              G
Hot air for a cool breeze? 
                 D
Cold comfort for change? 
              C
And did you exchange 
                      Am
A walk on part in the war 
                     G
For a lead role in a cage? 

G Em  G Em  G Em  A Em A   G  

C                               D
How I wish, how I wish you were here. 
           Am
We're just two lost souls 

Swimming in a fish bowl, 
G
Year after year, 
D                     
Running over the same old ground. 
             C
What have we found? 
             Am
The same old fears. 
              G
Wish you were here.

G Em  G Em  G Em  A Em A G  4x
