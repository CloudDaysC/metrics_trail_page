     Am                                   F

1. Come to decide that the things that I tried  

             C                   G

    were in my life just to get high on.  

Am                           F

    When I sit alone, come, get a little known,  

      C                                    G

    but I need more than myself this time.  

     Am                                    F

    Step from the road to the sea to the sky,  

              C                       G

    and I do believe what we rely on.  

Am                           F                                     C                   G

    When I lay it on, come, get to play it on, all my life to sacrifice. 

  

    Am   F  - C               G    Am   F  - C - G

                C                          G

    to the well one more time to decide on.  

Am                                   F

    When it<U+0092>s killing me, when will really see,  

     C                        G

    all that I need to look inside ?

     Am                               F

    Come to believe that I better not leave,  

         C                    G

    before I get my chance to ride.  

Am                                   F

    When it<U+0092>s killing me, what do I really need,  

     C                        G

    all that I need to look inside ?

    Come back and, hey oh,         look at what I say, oh. 

 

              F

    The more I see, the less I know,  

                                             Am                  F

   C                                         G

Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder,  

                Dm

where it<U+0092>s so white as snow.  

   C                                G

Privately divided by a world so undecided,  

                    Dm

and there<U+0092>s nowhere to go.  

C                                       G

In between the cover of another perfect wonder,  

                Dm

where it<U+0092>s so white as snow.  

  C                                                            G

Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed,

                    Dm

and there<U+0092>s nowhere to go.

3. When to descend to amend for a friend,  

                   C                           G

    all the channels that have broken down.  

Am                                F

    Now you bring it up, I<U+0092>m gonna ring it up,

    Step from the road to the sea to the sky,
