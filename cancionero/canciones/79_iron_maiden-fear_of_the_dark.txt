And then u take it away!!   =D (D, B, C, D)


The verse has the same chords that the part above, but they're
played with distortion. Hear very carefully the song so you can catch
the rhythm.  (sy, i copied that text...)

Verse2:

Have you run your fingers down the wall
And have you felt your neck skin crawl
When you're searching for the light
Sometimes when you're scared to take a look
At the corner of the room
You've sensed that something's watching you


Enjoy!  =D
