It's all the same,

Only the names have changed 
  Csus     G                                    
Everyday,                       
               C   F    D
It seems we're wasting away 
  D       D   Dsus D D7 D                  
Another place,                  
          Csus      G
Where the faces are so cold 
     Csus        G                      
I'd drive all night,            
        C   F    D
Just to get back home 
         C       G                 
I'm a cowboy,

On a steel horse I ride

Sometimes I sleep,                    
    Csus              G
Sometimes it's not for days 
    Csus      G                                 
The people I meet,

Always go their separate ways 
    D         D           Dsus D D7 D           
Sometimes you tell the day,                    
       Csus         G
By the bottle that you drink 
    Csus               G                         
And times when you're alone,            
     C      F     D
And all you do is think 
      C          G                 
I'm a cowboy,

A loaded six string on my back
